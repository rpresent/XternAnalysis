Data Science Sample Assesment

After doing data analysis, I found that the most convenient workspace is 350 Massachusettes Ave Suite 300 (Industrious Mass Ave).
This is the most conventient because it is only 1.9 miles away from Housing, which is an 8 minute drive and a 19 minute trip with public transportation.
This location is also surronded by restaurants, parks, and in the heart of downtown Indy with tons of activities.
